                <h1>24x7 Emergency Services</h1>
                <p>Kalra is known for providing advanced emergency services with rapid response for any kind of treatment. We have well-equipped emergency and trauma center with facilities of international standards. Our emergency department is always ready for these services. The department has state-of-the-art equipment and advanced patient monitoring systems to respond to any medical emergency.

                    The hospital provides round-the-clock emergency services, with a facility that is fully equipped and managed by a dedicated team of qualified emergency care professionals. A well-defined emergency management system has been developed to increase efficiency of rescue efforts. This includes enhanced first aid on site and improved overall coordination amongst the hospital staff involved in coping with emergency situations. We have developed</p>
                    <p>a special training module for every emergency that may arise. The highlights of our training are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic life support training is given regularly to nurses and paramedical staff</li>
                        <li>Advanced life support and advanced training in trauma management is given to doctors and ambulance staff</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>PRE-HOSPITAL CARE</h2>
                    <p>Kalra has a fleet of ambulance to handle every emergency situation. The fully air-conditioned ambulances are equipped with ventilators. All the ambulances have a wireless communication system with the emergency department of the hospital. The patient's details are discussed through this system with the expert consultants. Patients suffering from acute illness or injury are provided with immediate assistance by specialist doctors and trained nursing practitioners.</p>
                    <h2>ON ARRIVAL</h2>
                    <p>On arrival at Kalra, you will be taken to the casualty, and entitled to an immediate medical assistance by a doctor or nurse, who will determine the severity of your illness or injury. This is known as “triage process.” A triage nurse will take your temperature, pulse and blood pressure and ask you questions regarding your medical history.<br>Those suffering from critical condition or serious emergency are attended first. This means that in few cases people with less severe condition may need to wait.

                        If you have a note or letter from your doctor or a hospital, please present upon arrival.
                        
                        As the practitioners are completely unaware of your medical history, you will have to answer many questions. Sometimes, this needs to be done by a panel of consultants.</p>
                        <p>To help us assess your condition, please tell us about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any health problems you have had</li>
                             <li>All drugs and treatments that you are having</li>
                             <li>  Allergies that you have</li>
                             <li> If you are pregnant or breast feeding</li>
                             <li>  Any recent visits overseas</li>
                             <li>  Any other facts we should know about</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your visit to the emergency department may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>A Triage Room:</strong>When a large number of patients are admitted at the same time, patients with medical priorities are given the first preference.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resuscitation Room:</strong>Patients facing life-threatening problems are stabilized in this area by a team of specialist doctors. Resuscitation room is facilitated with monitors, defibrillators and ventilators.</li>
                            <li><strong>Back-up Support:</strong> The emergency department of the hospital is backed by a 24-hour blood bank, biochemistry labs, diagnostics imaging facilities and emergency operation theaters.</li>
                            <li><strong>Specialist Doctors:</strong> We have a team of specialist doctors available round-the-clock to treat all types of emergencies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>WHILE YOU ARE HERE</h2>
                        <P>patients are attended by emergency doctors and at times by senior specialists. In case there is severe exigency or critical case, the doctor may be delayed.</p>
                        <h2>MONITORING</h2>
                        <p>The patients at the hospital may be kept under observation to monitor the progress. Condition of the patient can be analyzed on the basis of display on the monitoring unit. The system is very sensitive, so one can hear an alarm even when there is any change in the patient's position.</p>
                        <h2>TESTING</h2>
                        <p>Your doctor may require specific tests such as blood tests or X-rays, ultrasound examination or computed tomography (CT) scans. An emergency department staff will attend you, when you leave the department for the tests. Please consult the doctor or nurse if you are unaware of the complexity of the test or the procedure.</p>
                        <h2>TREATMENT</h2>
                        <p>As soon as the test results are available, your doctor will discuss it with you and recommend a treatment or admission. Treatment can be simple or complex depending on the condition of the patient. In few cases, treatment can last for only few minutes or hours with simple medical aides such as splints, bandages, or medications. You may be referred to a team of specialists.

                            In complex treatment or surgeries, you may be required to submit a written consent.</p>
                        <h2>COMPLETING YOUR EMERGENCY VISIT</h2>
                        <p>The emergency visit is completed by either getting admitted to the hospital or released back to go home. You may be asked to visit the department again for a follow-up with the concerned specialist.

                            You will be required to make a full payment of the services availed at the hospital before being discharged.</p>
                        <h2>WHEN YOU ARE RELEASED</h2>
                        <p>Before leaving the emergency department, your nurse will provide you with the medical prescription and a set of guidelines for post-treatment care. Please make sure to clarify your concerns or if there is something that you do not understand. It is important for you to know how to handle injury or illness at home for speedy recovery.</p>
                         <h2>AT HOME</h2>
                         <p>Please feel free to contact us if you have any query related to your health, medication or further management. Several days after your visit, you may receive a call from the concerned department to take a feedback or note of the post-treatment health condition. Your care and satisfaction is our prior concern.</p>
                         <h2>WHEN YOU ARE ADMITTED</h2>
                         <p>We only advise you to get admitted in the hospital, when we are convinced that it is the best way to help you. If your admission is unplanned, it may take some time for the hospital bed to be ready.

                            You will be directed to admission desk for registering yourself, where you will be charged for the hospital services. In case you have medical insurance, it is advisable to inform admission desk personnel. You will have to make all the payments till your insurance company approves your admission in the hospital. This process may take time.
                            
                            The patients have the option of different rooms to choose from. As you are directed to the room, you will be escorted by the hospital staff and asked to put on a hospital gown. The placement may take time, if the rooms are pre-occupied.</p>
